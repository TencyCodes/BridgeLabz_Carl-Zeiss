**Issue Faced** : None

# 21st January , 2026

**What I have Done** :
* Practiced **Methods**.
* Started **OOPs** (Classes, Objects, Methods, Access Modifiers, Encapsulation).

**What I Will Do Next** :
* Understand and practice more **OOPs concepts**.

**Issue Faced** : None

# 22nd January, 2026

**What I have Done:**
Practiced and understood from first principles:
- **Class and Object**
- Creating objects using **new**
- **Instance members vs Static members**
- **Fields** (Public vs Private, Instance, Static)

**What I Will Do Next:**
- **Readonly fields**
- **Methods** (Instance, Static, Parameters & Return Types, Overloading)
- **Constructors** (Default, Parameterized, Overloading, Chaining using `this()`)
- **Access Modifiers** (public, private, protected, internal, protected internal, private protected)
- **Properties** (Getters & Setters, Auto-properties, Read-only, Write-only)
- **Encapsulation** (Data hiding using private fields, exposing behavior via public methods/properties)

**Issue Faced :** None

# 23rd January, 2026

**What I have Done:**
- Studied and practiced **Constructors**:
  - Default constructor
  - Parameterized constructor
  - Constructor overloading
  - Constructor chaining using `this()`
- Practiced **Access Modifiers**:
  - public, private, protected, internal, protected internal, private protected
- Studied **Properties (Encapsulation)**:
  - Getters and setters
  - Auto-implemented properties
  - Read-only properties
  - Write-only properties

**What I Will Do Next:**
- Study **Encapsulation (Core Pillar)**
- Start **Intermediate OOP Concepts**:
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstraction
  - Interfaces

**Issue Faced:** None
